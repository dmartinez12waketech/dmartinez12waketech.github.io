<p style="font-size: 18px">As senior in high school, I didn’t know what I wanted to make a career in. I settled on a business degree, believing it would it expose me to various different subjects in which I could find my niche. I loved every class that tapped into my analytical side – Finance, Accounting, Computer Software, and Information Systems, among others. Upon graduation, I applied for several roles in these fields and found success as a Project Accountant, and I really enjoyed the work and experience I have gained thus far in my career.<br>
<br>
However, over the years I had a thought gnawing at the back of my mind about how much I loved the courses I had taken in Information Technology. Specifically, I dwelled on an assignment where I had to create a website, which I created about cats. As silly as it may seem, I loved writing up the html code to make the website; with every change I made in the code, I was elated to watch it come to life on screen. By the end of the project, I had so much joy in clicking around on my website, and was delighted to have a project that not only tapped into my analytical side, but my creative side as well. <br>
<br>
As the thoughts became louder in my head, they became impossible to ignore, and I decided I wanted to pivot my professional path towards Web Development. As I continue on this educational journey, I hope that my current professional background as well as my drive and passion for Web Development will keep me in your mind and professional network for current and upcoming opportunities. </p>
