Hi! My name is Danielle and I am currently residing in Raleigh, North Carolina. I am a full-time accountant and part-time student. Outside of focusing on my career, you can find me doing one of my various shifting hobbies – such as making pottery, practicing aerial silks, or spending time on nature trails.

As senior in high school, I didn’t know what I wanted to make a career in. I settled on a business degree, believing it would it expose me to various different subjects in which I could find my niche. I loved every class that tapped into my analytical side – Finance, Accounting, Computer Software, and Information Systems, among others. Upon graduation, I applied for several roles in these fields and found success as a Project Accountant, and I really enjoyed the work and experience I have gained thus far in my career.

However, over the years I had a thought gnawing at the back of my mind about how much I loved the courses I had taken in Information Technology. Specifically, I dwelled on an assignment where I had to create a website, which I created about cats. As silly as it may seem, I loved writing up the html code to make the website; with every change I made in the code, I was elated to watch it come to life on screen. By the end of the project, I had so much joy in clicking around on my website, and was delighted to have a project that not only tapped into my analytical side, but my creative side as well. 
As the thoughts became louder in my head, they became impossible to ignore, and I decided I wanted to pivot my professional path towards Web Development. As I continue on this educational journey, I hope that my current professional background as well as my drive and passion for Web Development will keep me in your mind and professional network for current and upcoming opportunities.
